/*
Modify the broker.c program of Section 5.2 by making both of the following changes:
(a) Ask the user to enter the number of shares and the price per share, instead of the value
of the trade.
(b) Add statements that compute the commission charged by a rival booker ($33 plus 3c per
share for fewer than 2000 share; $33 plus 2c per share for 2000 shares or more). Display
the rival's commission as well as the commission charged by the original broker.
